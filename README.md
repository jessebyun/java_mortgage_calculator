<h1>Mortgage Calculator</h1>
Created a mortgage calculator using Java programming language. First wrote the mortgage calculator program in procedural code. Then I refactored the program into Object-Oriented Design using modules for the difference sections of code. 

<h2>Procedural Code</h2>
Procedural programming structures the code into a logical order or steps. It is straightforward and direct. It is great for simple tasks or programs with just a few lines of code. However as a program grows, procedural code can become harder to maintain and understand due to the lack of abstraction and organization. 

<h2>Object-Oriented Design (OOD)</h2>

<h2>Refactoring</h2>
