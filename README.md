<h1>Mortgage Calculator</h1>
Created a mortgage calculator using Java programming language. First wrote the mortgage calculator program in procedural code. Then I refactored the program into Object-Oriented Design using modules for the difference sections of code. 

<h2>Procedural Code</h2>
Procedural programming structures the code into a logical order or steps and executes sequences of instructions. It is straightforward and direct. It is great for simple tasks or programs with just a few lines of code. However as a program grows, procedural programming can become harder to maintain and understand due to the lack of abstraction and organization. 

<h2>Object-Oriented Design (OOD)</h2>
Object-Oriented Programming is based on the concept of "objects" which can contain data and methods to manipulate that data. Objects are instances of classes, which define the blueprint for these objects. This design approach makes software more modular, reusable, and easier to maintain. Modular design makes it easier to break down complex systems into manageable pieces. Objects and classes can be reused across projects which can promote scalability and also reduce redundancy.
